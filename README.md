# CSC258H5-Fall-2024-Project-Sokoban
The two files of interest:
* `Project/SUBMISSION_Proj_Sokoban_CODE.s`
* `Project/SUBMISSION_Proj_Sokoban_DOCUMENTATION.pdf`

This project from CSC258H5, Fall 2024, showcases my ability to write robust code in RISC-V 32i assembly &amp; excellent documentation for clear communication.

In particular:

* RISC-V Assembly Programming (ISA, registers, stack management)
* Algorithm Design (procedural level generation, LFSR RNG)
* Memory & Stack Management (frame pointer, stack pointer usage)
* Systems Programming (syscalls, user input handling)
* Debugging & Testing (memory inspection, state validation)
* Software Engineering (modular functions, documentation, best practices)
