    # TODO: Generate locations for the character, box, and target. Static
    # locations in memory have been provided for the (x, y) coordinates 
    # of each of these elements.
    # 
    # There is a notrand function that you can use to start with. It's 
    # really not very good; you will replace it with your own rand function
    # later. Regardless of the source of your "random" locations, make 
    # sure that none of the items are on top of each other and that the 
    # board is solvable.
   
    # TODO: Now, print the gameboard. Select symbols to represent the walls,
    # character, box, and target. Write a function that uses the location of
    # the various elements (in memory) to construct a gameboard and that 
    # prints that board one character at a time.
    # HINT: You may wish to construct the string that represents the board
    # and then print that string with a single syscall. If you do this, 
    # consider whether you want to place this string in static memory or 
    # on the stack. 

    # TODO: Enter a loop and wait for user input. Whenever user input is
    # received, update the gameboard state with the new location of the 
    # player (and if applicable, box and target). Print a message if the 
    # input received is invalid or if it results in no change to the game 
    # state. Otherwise, print the updated game state. 
    #
    # You will also need to restart the game if the user requests it and 
    # indicate when the box is located in the same position as the target.
    # For the former, it may be useful for this loop to exist in a function,
    # to make it cleaner to exit the game loop.

    # TODO: That's the base game! Now, pick a pair of enhancements and
    # consider how to implement them.
